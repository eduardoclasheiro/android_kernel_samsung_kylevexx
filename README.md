This is a direct and experimental PORT

NOT WORKING : CAMERA (preview working), GOVERNORS (INTERACTIVE is working ;-) )

ONLY CM-11.0 branch

 This port Fix GPU/ION drivers in device (expect Better gpu and memory performance).

That was the only way i(@eduardoclasheiro) found to fix random reboots on some apps in CM-11.0 .

Tested on CM-12.1 fixed White line random reboots (but device reboot when put to sleep ;-d )
